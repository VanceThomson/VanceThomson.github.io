Bluegill are small but super fun fish to catch, especially in ponds and calm lakes. They love hiding near weeds, docks, and shallow water where they can find bugs and small food. The best baits to use for bluegill are worms, tiny jigs, mealworms, or small pieces of corn. Light line and small hooks work great, because bluegill can be shy and nibble gently. Even though they are small, they are perfect for beginners and can be caught all day, especially when the water is warm.
