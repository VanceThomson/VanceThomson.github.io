<h1>Trout</h1>
<p><p>Trout fishing is one of the best ways to enjoy calm water and cool weather. Trout love clean, cold ponds, rivers, and streams. They can be picky, so I like to use small spinners, worms, or bright-colored PowerBait to grab their attention. Early morning or cloudy days are perfect for catching them because that’s when they come closer to the surface. Trout put up a good fight, and reeling one in feels amazing — especially when you see that flash of silver in the water! Some of the best things to fish for trout with are small inline spinners, salmon eggs, worms, and PowerBait on light line — trout usually go for natural colors like green, brown, or white.</p>
